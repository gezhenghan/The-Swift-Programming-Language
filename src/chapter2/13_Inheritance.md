## Inheritance
## 继承

A class can *inherit* methods, properties, and other characteristics from another class. When one class inherits from another, the inheriting class is known as a *subclass*, and the class it inherits from is known as its *superclass*.

一个类可以从另外一个类中继承方法，属性以及其他特性。当一个类继承另外一个类时，这个类被称作为子类，而被继承的类被称作为父类。
